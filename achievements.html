    <p>I always had a passion for learning new things and discovering the "mysteries" of the world around me. In primary school, I was mostly interested in mathematics, which eventually brought me a couple of prizes at local contests and olympiads. After
      the sixth grade, I partially left math behind and started rigorously learning Physics. With the help of my colleagues and my wonderful professor, I realised that <i>it was worth it!</i> Here is a list of results I obtained over the years, sorted
      in chronological order (from the oldest to the most recent), where <b>LPhO</b> – Physics Olympiad - local phase, <b>CPhO</b> – Physics Olympiad - county phase, <b>NPhO</b> – Physics Olypiad, national phase:</p>
