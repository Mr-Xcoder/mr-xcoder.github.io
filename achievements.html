    <p>I always had a passion for learning new things and discovering the "mysteries" of the world around me. In primary school, I was mostly interested in mathematics, which eventually brought me a couple of prizes at local contests and olympiads. After the sixth grade, I partially left math behind and started rigorously learning Physics. With the help of my colleagues and my wonderful professor, I realised that <i>it was worth it!</i> Here is a list of results I obtained over the years, sorted in chronological order (from the oldest to the most recent):</p>
    <br/>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ranked #1 at the <b>local olympiad (6th Grade)</b>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Top 10 at the <b>county olympiad (6th Grade)</b>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Won the <b>Procopiu National Physics Contest â€“ Teams (6th Grade)</b>, after having ranked #4 at the <b>county stage</b> of the same competition.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ranked #7 at the <b>local olympiad (7th Grade)</b>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ranked #1 at the <b>county olympiad (7th Grade)</b> and qualified to the <b>national phase</b>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participated and received a honourable mention at <b>Evrika National Contest (7th Grade)</b>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Received a bronze medal at the <b>National Physics Olypiad (7th Grade)</b></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ranked #5 at the <b>Isaac Newton national contest (8th Grade)</b>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ranked #1 at the <b>local olypiad (8th Grade)</b>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ranked #2 at the <b>county olympiad (8th grade)</b> and qualified to the <b>national phase</b>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Received a bronze medal <sup>(again...)</sup> at the <b>National Physics Olypiad (8th Grade)</b>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Received the second prize at the <b>County Olympiad of Junior Sciences (Biology, Chemistry and Physics)</b> and qualified to the <b>national phase</b>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, more will be added to this list soon! Currently studying intensively in the fields of Physics, Astronomy, Astrophysics and Earth Sciences and looking forward to participating in the competitions to come.</p>
