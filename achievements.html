    <p>I always had a passion for learning new things and discovering the "mysteries" of the world around me. In primary school, I was mostly interested in mathematics, which eventually brought me a couple of prizes at local contests and olympiads. After the sixth grade, I partially left math behind and started rigorously learning Physics. With the help of my colleagues and my wonderful professor, I realised that <i>it was worth it!</i> Here is a list of results I obtained over the years, sorted in chronological order (from the oldest to the most recent):</p>
    <br/>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ranked #1 at the <b>local olympiad (6th Grade)</b>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Top 10 at the <b>county olympiad (6th Grade)</b>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Won the <b>Procopiu National Physics Contest â€“ Teams (6th Grade)</b>, after having ranked #4 at the <b>county stage</b> of the same competition.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ranked #7 at the <b>local olympiad (7th grade)</b>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ranked #1 at the <b>county olympiad (7th grade)</b> and qualified to the <b>national phase</b>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participated and received a honourable mention at <b>Evrika National Contest (7th grade)</b>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Received a bronze medal at the <b>National Physics Olypiad (7th garde)</b> (the most notable result of mine so far).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ranked #5 at the <b>Isaac Newton national contest</b>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ranked #1 at the <b>local olypiad (8th garde)</b>.</p>
